What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a hidden ".git" folder is created with the appropriate files to start your git project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area or HEAD is the proposed changes to be committed since the last commit (working directory). The HEAD differs from
the repository, because the repository is the log of all existing commits.
