When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The best time to use remote repositories is when you're collaborating a project with multiple people
working on it. It's a more efficient way to share work collectively.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 - Forks are copies of repositories found online @GitHub. These copies are saved to your GitHub colleciton. Forks
   can be used when you want to copy another person's work.
 - Clones are also copies of repositories, but they are directly stored locally. They can come from online or local
   repositories. This is an awesome option if you only want to save your files to work on offline.
 - Branches are changes made to the same repository. This can also be a copy of a current repository, but the copy is
   copied to a more closely related storage space. The branch is great to use for experimental changes and non-
   commercial ready product.
